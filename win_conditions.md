- Teacher
for the teacher the win condition is to have pomodoro system set up to keep track of the work.
for each pomodoro started:
  who?
  was it finished?
  what GH Issue? (should be open, assigned to person)
  support estimation (later)
data integrity (probably means relying on our own db, not just GH comments)


- Students
for the students the win condition is for the system to be easy to use.
