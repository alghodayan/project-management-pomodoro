# project-management-template

This repo is designed to guide you in planning and managing the process of designing, building, and deploying a system-- either software, hardware, or a combination.

The guidance is based on the spiral process model developed by Barry Boehm. Page numbers used elsewhere in this repo refer to [this document](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/reports/00sr008.pdf).

You will use the other files in this repo to capture various work products, and the relationships between them. Per the spiral model, you will use risk analysis to determine the amount of effort invested in each type of work product, and the order you work on them.

Initially, the milestone cards are in order. As you meet each milestone, you will move its card to the bottom of this list. In other words, the milestone that appears at the top of the list is the one that you are currently working towards.

That "next" milestone card contains a checklist that tells you what to aim for. The card should always have a Due Date that is no more than 2 to 3 weeks in the future. On that date, all success-critical stakeholders should meet, and attempt to reach agreement on the items in the card's first checklist. The outcome of the meeting is documented by one of the three choices in the card's second checklist.
