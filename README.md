# Project Management for (project name)

This repo is designed to guide you in planning and managing the process of designing, building, and deploying a system-- either software, hardware, or a combination.

The guidance is based on the spiral process model developed by Barry Boehm. Page numbers used elsewhere in this repo refer to [this document](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/reports/00sr008.pdf).

The first three Issues in this repo will guide you through a process of stakeholder reviews that progress through the Anchor Point Milestones shown below.

You will use the other files in this repo to capture various work products, and the relationships between them. Per the spiral model, you will use risk analysis to determine the amount of effort invested in each type of work product, and the order you work on them.
